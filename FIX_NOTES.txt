FIXED: Template Path Error in Executable

PROBLEM:
The executable was looking for templates in the wrong location because PyInstaller
extracts bundled files to a temporary directory (sys._MEIPASS), not next to the .exe.

SOLUTION:
Added resource_path() function that correctly uses sys._MEIPASS for bundled files
when running as executable, and normal paths when running as script.

WHAT TO DO:
1. Rebuild the executable:
   - Run: build_standalone.bat
   - Or: py -m PyInstaller anvesh.spec --clean --noconfirm

2. Test the new executable:
   - Double-click dist\Anvesh.exe
   - It should now find templates and static files correctly
   - Browser should open and show the interface

The fix ensures:
- Templates are found from the bundled location
- Static files are found from the bundled location  
- History file is saved next to the .exe (for persistence)
